\question{1: why can the two-dimensional data we stored in \texttt{X} be reconstructed so well using only one principal component?}



\question{2: make a scatter plot that contains true and reconstructed values $(k=1)$, as well as the single principal component.}

\question{3: can you come up with a feature transformation (for one or more column(s) of \texttt{big\_X} by looking at \texttt{X\_train}) that would make the principal components express more of the data's variance?}



\question{4: what is a good number of principal components to continue with \textit{and why}? (Base your answer only on this training set.)}



\question{5 (2 points): how do the computation time and accuracies differ between the repeated evaluations with and without PCA, and how do you explain this? (Specify $k$ if you do not use the value you chose above.)}



\question{6 (bonus): test your theory.}



\pagebreak[4]

\question{7: can you describe a situation where (or model for which) PCA would not help?}




\question{8: make scatterplots of (either train, test, or all) points expressed in terms of 1: the first two principal components; 2: the first two numerical features.}

\question{9 (2 points): what do the first two principal components represent, when you think back to what the numerical features are based on?}
