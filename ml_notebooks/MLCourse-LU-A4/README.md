## Assignment 4: dimensionality reduction

This repository contains the exercises and questions for assignment 4.

## How to start
* Start by cloning this repository to your computer. 
* You can do the assignment on your own computer, or use Google Colab.
    1. To run it **locally**, make sure that you have Python 3 (.7.10 and .8.8 are tested) with numpy, matplotlib, and scikit_learn installed (see requirements.txt for specific versions; optionally also of nbimporter and pytest). Try running `jupyter notebook` from the command line. 
    2. To use **Google Colab**, you need to upload `A4.ipynb`. 
    3. The notebook contains the information on how to continue!

If you have difficulty installing a needed package, we recommend either asking for help or switching to Colab. In Colab, to install a package, you can run a cell with the command:

`!pip install (name of package)`

The `!` will send the command out of the notebook, to the command line of Google Colab.
